At Frontier R&D, I build and maintain developer tools that empower Bible translators around the world. My work spans three key projects:

## Codex Editor

I maintain a whitelabeled VSCode build ([genesis-ai-dev/codex](https://github.com/genesis-ai-dev/codex)) used as a platform for custom extensions for translating resources. This involves implementing Windows code signing and various patches to customize the editor into a tailored translation tool.

## Web Codex

I built a scalable Kubernetes platform ([genesis-ai-dev/web-codex](https://github.com/genesis-ai-dev/web-codex)) to host Codex Editor instances online, removing the requirement for local installation. This allows translators to access their workspace from any browser without needing to set up a local development environment.

## Extension Sideloader

I built a custom extension ([andrewhertog/extension-sideloader](https://github.com/andrewhertog/extension-sideloader)) into the Codex binary that automatically installs a specific set of extensions, eliminating the need to bundle them into the binary while providing a natural VSCode-like extension management experience.
