As a Staff Site Reliability Engineer at Prodigy Education, I am responsible for not only the 
day to day monitoring and supporting of Prodigy's architecture on AWS, but also for providing
guidence to leadership and engineering for the direction we should take with the future of our 
infrastructure.

This means that I am often investigating and testing new tools and services to implement within 
our infrastructure, and writing documentation and assiting with the implementation of such tools.

Some examples are:
- Migrating away from ECR/NPMjs to self-managed JFrog Artifactory
- Replacing Kubernetes External Secrets with External Secrets Operator
